		<p>“ActiveAtHome” is an innovative online platform designed to connect users with certified 
		personal trainers who offer personalized fitness sessions at home. It provides a convenient
		way for users who cannot visit a gym to find professional trainers who can tailor their
		workout needs from the comfort of their home.</p>
		<p>Users can browse through the profiles of trainers registered on the platform and identify
		activities that interest them. The platform is managed by a group of administrators who are
		responsible for approving trainers, managing and updating their profiles, and keeping the list
		of available classes up to date.
